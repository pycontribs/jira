Quickstart
==========

Initialization
--------------

Everything goes through the JIRA object, so make one::

    from jira import JIRA

    jira = JIRA()

This connects to a JIRA started on your local machine at http://localhost:2990/jira, which not coincidentally is the
default address for a JIRA instance started from the Atlassian Plugin SDK.

You can manually set the JIRA server to use::

    jac = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com')

Authentication
--------------

At initialization time, jira-python can optionally create an HTTP BASIC or use OAuth 1.0a access tokens for user
authentication. These sessions will apply to all subsequent calls to the JIRA object.

The library is able to load the credentials from inside the ~/.netrc file, so put them there instead of keeping them in your source code.

HTTP BASIC
^^^^^^^^^^

Pass a tuple of (username, password) to the ``basic_auth`` constructor argument::

    authed_jira = JIRA(basic_auth=('username', 'password'))

OAuth
^^^^^

Pass a dict of OAuth properties to the ``oauth`` constructor argument::

    # all values are samples and won't work in your code!
    key_cert_data = None
    with open(key_cert, 'r') as key_cert_file:
        key_cert_data = key_cert_file.read()

    oauth_dict = {
        'access_token': 'd87f3hajglkjh89a97f8',
        'access_token_secret': 'a9f8ag0ehaljkhgeds90',
        'consumer_key': 'jira-oauth-consumer',
        'key_cert': key_cert_data
    }
    authed_jira = JIRA(oauth=oauth_dict)

.. note ::
    The OAuth access tokens must be obtained and authorized ahead of time through the standard OAuth dance. For
    interactive use, ``jirashell`` can perform the dance with you if you don't already have valid tokens.

.. note ::
    OAuth in Jira uses RSA-SHA1 which requires the PyCrypto library. PyCrypto is **not** installed automatically
    when installing jira-python. See also the :ref:`Dependencies`. section above.

* The access token and token secret uniquely identify the user.
* The consumer key must match the OAuth provider configured on the JIRA server.
* The key cert data must be the private key that matches the public key configured on the JIRA server's OAuth provider.

See https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+OAuth+Authentication+for+an+Application+Link for details
on configuring an OAuth provider for JIRA.

Kerberos
^^^^^^^^

To enable Kerberos auth, set ``kerberos=True``::

    authed_jira = JIRA(kerberos=True)

.. _jirashell-label:

cookiestxt
^^^^^^^^^^

To access a corporate instance of JIRA that is authenticated behind some single sign-on solution, log in via Firefox with the `Export Cookies addon <https://addons.mozilla.org/EN-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies/>`_ and export the cookies.

Pass a cookies.txt path ``cookiestxt`` constructor argument::

    authed_jira = JIRA(cookiestxt="/tmp/cookies.txt")

Issues
------

Issues are objects. You get hold of them through the JIRA object::

    issue = jira.issue('JRA-1330')

Issue JSON is marshaled automatically and used to augment the returned Issue object, so you can get direct access to
fields::

    summary = issue.fields.summary         # 'Field level security permissions'
    votes = issue.fields.votes.votes       # 440 (at least)

If you only want a few specific fields, save time by asking for them explicitly::

    issue = jira.issue('JRA-1330', fields='summary,comment')

Reassign an issue::

    # requires issue assign permission, which is different from issue editing permission!
    jira.assign_issue(issue, 'newassignee')

Creating issues is easy::

    new_issue = jira.create_issue(project='PROJ_key_or_id', summary='New issue from jira-python',
                                  description='Look into this one', issuetype={'name': 'Bug'})

Or you can use a dict::

    issue_dict = {
        'project': {'id': 123},
        'summary': 'New issue from jira-python',
        'description': 'Look into this one',
        'issuetype': {'name': 'Bug'},
    }
    new_issue = jira.create_issue(fields=issue_dict)

You can even bulk create multiple issues::

    issue_list = [
    {
        'project': {'id': 123},
        'summary': 'First issue of many',
        'description': 'Look into this one',
        'issuetype': {'name': 'Bug'},
    },
    {
        'project': {'key': 'FOO'},
        'summary': 'Second issue',
        'description': 'Another one',
        'issuetype': {'name': 'Bug'},
    },
    {
        'project': {'name': 'Bar'},
        'summary': 'Last issue',
        'description': 'Final issue of batch.',
        'issuetype': {'name': 'Bug'},
    }]
    issues = jira.create_issues(field_list=issue_list)

.. note::
    Project, summary, description and issue type are always required when creating issues. Your JIRA may require
    additional fields for creating issues; see the ``jira.createmeta`` method for getting access to that information.

.. note::
    Using bulk create will not throw an exception for a failed issue creation. It will return a list of dicts that
    each contain a possible error signature if that issue had invalid fields. Successfully created issues will contain
    the issue object as a value of the ``issue`` key.

You can also update an issue's fields with keyword arguments::

    issue.update(summary='new summary', description='A new summary was added')
    issue.update(assignee={'name': 'new_user'})    # reassigning in update requires issue edit permission

or with a dict of new field values::

    issue.update(fields={'summary': 'new summary', 'description': 'A new summary was added'})

You can suppress notifications::

    issue.update(notify=False, description='A quiet description change was made')

and when you're done with an issue, you can send it to the great hard drive in the sky::

    issue.delete()

Updating components::

    existingComponents = []
    for component in issue.fields.components:
        existingComponents.append({"name" : component.name})
    issue.update(fields={"components": existingComponents})


Fields
------

    issue.fields.worklogs                                 # list of Worklog objects
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].author
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].comment
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].created
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].id
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].self
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].started
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].timeSpent
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].timeSpentSeconds
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].updateAuthor                # dictionary
    issue.fields.worklogs[0].updated


    issue.fields.timetracking.remainingEstimate           # may be NULL or string ("0m", "2h"...)
    issue.fields.timetracking.remainingEstimateSeconds    # may be NULL or integer
    issue.fields.timetracking.timeSpent                   # may be NULL or string
    issue.fields.timetracking.timeSpentSeconds            # may be NULL or integer


Searching
---------

Leverage the power of `JQL <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching>`_
to quickly find the issues you want::

    issues_in_proj = jira.search_issues('project=PROJ')
    all_proj_issues_but_mine = jira.search_issues('project=PROJ and assignee != currentUser()')

    # my top 5 issues due by the end of the week, ordered by priority
    oh_crap = jira.search_issues('assignee = currentUser() and due < endOfWeek() order by priority desc', maxResults=5)

    # Summaries of my last 3 reported issues
    print [issue.fields.summary for issue in jira.search_issues('reporter = currentUser() order by created desc', maxResults=3)]

Comments
--------

Comments, like issues, are objects. Get at issue comments through the parent Issue object or the JIRA object's
dedicated method::

    comments_a = issue.fields.comment.comments
    comments_b = jira.comments(issue) # comments_b == comments_a

Get an individual comment if you know its ID::

    comment = jira.comment('JRA-1330', '10234')

Adding, editing and deleting comments is similarly straightforward::

    comment = jira.add_comment('JRA-1330', 'new comment')    # no Issue object required
    comment = jira.add_comment(issue, 'new comment', visibility={'type': 'role', 'value': 'Administrators'})  # for admins only

    comment.update(body = 'updated comment body')
    comment.delete()

Transitions
-----------

Learn what transitions are available on an issue::

    issue = jira.issue('PROJ-1')
    transitions = jira.transitions(issue)
    [(t['id'], t['name']) for t in transitions]    # [(u'5', u'Resolve Issue'), (u'2', u'Close Issue')]

.. note::
    Only the transitions available to the currently authenticated user will be returned!

Then perform a transition on an issue::

    # Resolve the issue and assign it to 'pm_user' in one step
    jira.transition_issue(issue, '5', assignee={'name': 'pm_user'}, resolution={'id': '3'})

    # The above line is equivalent to:
    jira.transition_issue(issue, '5', fields: {'assignee':{'name': 'pm_user'}, 'resolution':{'id': '3'}})

Projects
--------

Projects are objects, just like issues::

    projects = jira.projects()

Also, just like issue objects, project objects are augmented with their fields::

    jra = jira.project('JRA')
    print(jra.name)                 # 'JIRA'
    print(jra.lead.displayName)     # 'Paul Slade [Atlassian]'

It's no trouble to get the components, versions or roles either (assuming you have permission)::

    components = jira.project_components(jra)
    [c.name for c in components]                # 'Accessibility', 'Activity Stream', 'Administration', etc.

    jira.project_roles(jra)                     # 'Administrators', 'Developers', etc.

    versions = jira.project_versions(jra)
    [v.name for v in reversed(versions)]        # '5.1.1', '5.1', '5.0.7', '5.0.6', etc.

Watchers
--------

Watchers are objects, represented by :class:`jira.resources.Watchers`::

    watcher = jira.watchers(issue)
    print("Issue has {} watcher(s)".format(watcher.watchCount))
    for watcher in watcher.watchers:
        print(watcher)
        # watcher is instance of jira.resources.User:
        print(watcher.emailAddress)

You can add users to watchers by their name::

    jira.add_watcher(issue, 'username')
    jira.add_watcher(issue, user_resource.name)

And of course you can remove users from watcher::

    jira.remove_watcher(issue, 'username')
    jira.remove_watcher(issue, user_resource.name)

Attachments
-----------

Attachments let user add files to issues. First you'll need an issue to which the attachment will be uploaded.
Next, you'll need file itself, that is going to be attachment. File could be file-like object or string, representing
path on local machine. Also you can select final name of the attachment if you don't like original.
Here are some examples::

    # upload file from `/some/path/attachment.txt`
    jira.add_attachment(issue=issue, attachment='/some/path/attachment.txt')

    # read and upload a file (note binary mode for opening, it's important):
    with open('/some/path/attachment.txt', 'rb') as f:
        jira.add_attachment(issue=issue, attachment=f)

    # attach file from memory (you can skip IO operations). In this case you MUST provide `filename`.
    import StringIO
    attachment = StringIO.StringIO()
    attachment.write(data)
    jira.add_attachment(issue=issue, attachment=attachment, filename='content.txt')

If you would like to list all available attachment, you can do it with through attachment field::


    for attachment in issue.fields.attachment:
        print("Name: '{filename}', size: {size}".format(
            filename=attachment.filename, size=attachment.size))
        # to read content use `get` method:
        print("Content: '{}'".format(attachment.get()))


You can delete attachment by id::

    # Find issues with attachments:
    query = jira.search_issues(jql_str="attachments is not EMPTY", json_result=True, fields="key, attachment")

    # And remove attachments one by one
    for i in query['issues']:
        for a in i['fields']['attachment']:
            print("For issue {0}, found attach: '{1}' [{2}].".format(i['key'], a['filename'], a['id']))
            jira.delete_attachment(a['id'])
