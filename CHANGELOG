2015-07-15 Minor fixes to jirashell issues #100, #102, and #66, and tweaks fix from d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086. The oauth_dance and print_tokens options specified in jirashell.ini configuration file are now correctly parsed as boolean values and OAuth with pre-authenticated access_token and access_token_secret (skipping oauth_dance) is fixed. OAuth options are now minimally validated for completeness, so #66 is fixed, allowing for basic_auth without causing issue #102 as the merged commit d5856742771890ad18165197f6bc7eb3ff8cd086 did previously.
2015-07-15 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'
2015-07-15 Fixed #88 so now groups are returned as a sorted list of strings.
2015-07-15 Fix issue #100 - The problem is that 'oauth_dance' should be an optional option argument, if it is not set, or if it is set to false, a valid use case still exists where OAuth should be used if the user supplies access_token and access_token_secret through command line or configuration file options. This would be the case if the user had already authenticated externally with OAuth and had valid, authenticated tokens to pass to jirashell.
