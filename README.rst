This library eases the use of the Jira REST API from Python and it has been used in production for years.

As this is an open-source project that is community maintained, do not be surprised if some bugs or features are not implemented quickly enough. You are always welcomed to use BountySource_ to motivate others to help.

Quickstart
----------

Feeling impatient? I like your style.

.. code-block:: python

    from jira import JIRA

    jira = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com')

    issue = jira.issue('JRA-9')
    print(issue.fields.project.key)            # 'JRA'
    print(issue.fields.issuetype.name)         # 'New Feature'
    print(issue.fields.reporter.displayName)   # 'Mike Cannon-Brookes [Atlassian]'


Installation
------------

Download and install using ``pip install jira`` or ``easy_install jira``

You can also try ``pip install --user --upgrade jira`` which will install or
upgrade jira to your user directory. Or maybe you ARE using a virtualenv_
right?

By default only the basic library dependencies are installed, so if you want
to use the ``cli`` tool or other optional dependencies do perform a full
installation using ``pip install jira[opt,cli,test]``

Usage
