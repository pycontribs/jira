.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/pycontribs/jira.git@3.10.1

if you dont have git installed on your system or you prefer whl files you can install the 3.10.1 like below.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/releases/download/3.10.1/jira-3.10.1-py3-none-any.whl

in your requirements.txt or pyproject.toml you can temporarily add this release like so.

This library eases the use of the Jira REST API from Python and it has been used in production for years.

As this is an open-source project that is community maintained, do not be surprised if some bugs or features are not implemented quickly enough.


Quickstart
----------

Feeling impatient? I like your style.

.. code-block:: python

    from jira import JIRA

    jira = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com')

    issue = jira.issue('JRA-9')
    print(issue.fields.project.key)            # 'JRA'
    print(issue.fields.issuetype.name)         # 'New Feature'
    print(issue.fields.reporter.displayName)   # 'Mike Cannon-Brookes [Atlassian]'


Installation
------------

Download and install using ``pip install jira`` or ``easy_install jira``

You can also try ``pip install --user --upgrade jira`` which will install or
upgrade jira to your user directory. Or maybe you ARE using a virtualenv_
right?

By default only the basic library dependencies are installed, so if you want
to use the ``cli`` tool or other optional dependencies do perform a full
installation using ``pip install jira[opt,cli,test]``

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/


Usage
-----

See the documentation_ for full details.
